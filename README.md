# KomaHighOrder
This is a Julia toolbox for MR simulation that can incorporate dynamic field changes associated with the gradients throughout the sequence. 
This is an extension of KomaMRI.jl (https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl), a Julia package for highly efficient MR simulations.
You may run the demo script, `/example/demo_sim.jl`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to simulate MRI signals given a pulseq sequence and dynamic field changes measured using a field camera. 

If you use the toolbox, please consider citing the following abstract:
